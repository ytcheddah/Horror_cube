Monster class idea/reference:

class Monster(object)
    def __init__(self, name, image, pos_x, pos_y, health, attack, speed, agro_type, agro_ratio, agro_distance):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.image = image
        self.pos_x = pos_x
        self.pos_y = pos_y
        self.pos = pygame.math.Vector2(MONSTER_SPAWN_X, MONSTER_SPAWN_Y)
        self.health = health
        self.attack = attack
        self.speed = speed
        self.agro_type = agro_type
        self.agro_ratio = agro_ratio
        self.agro_distance = agro_distance
        self.velocity_x = 0
        self.velocity_y = 0


agro_type       = whether monster is aggrod by sight, sound, or proximity 
agro_ratio      = how likely an agro event is to trigger an agro state      (EX: 1.0 = 100% .5 = 50%, etc.)
agro_distance   = how far an event needs to be from the center of the monster in order to trigger an agro state

*alert animation or state for when something doesnt agro from agro agro_ratio

monster states = sleep_state, idle_state, alert_state, agro_state

IDEAS:

whole game is 1 Large Map, short, gets harder every time you beat it, goal is to complete runs (and story) and unlock more items/artifacts
and enemies. Dark room, you find flashlights to see more of the map, you dodge enemies and obsticles to get to safe zone
purely dodge, no attacking, enemies can attack but low/no projectiles. Find notes in game for the lore, have them be accessible
in the game, not required to beat the game, BUT they are achievement faughter and extra credit. TV can be what teleports you from
map to map. end of game you become a monster.
In depth item collection, artifacts, things that affect future runs
want player to be scared of the game even tho its a top down 2d game.
constant tension and threat of being caught/chase while solving a puzzle.
*Monsters will need procedurial animation
    -notes-
        vector from anchor with radius and additionally any point then scale vector to desired distance ea distance restraint
            this can make a snake like animation that is based off an algorithm
        the radius can alter in size and vary the body-shape and size of the animal, useful for lizard-like bodies
        3 quarter turns from any anchor spot bound vector can determine body positions for features such as limbs
        spine needs a maximum level of flexibility through angle restraints, if an angle is too big, it can be altered to a diff value
        *kinematics*
            Forward and Inverse Kinematics - will be needed for limbs and natural movement for reaching desired anchor positions
                *FABRIK* = Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics
            FABRIK chain can be attached to a leg as its connector for a foot, and the distance control is the steps
            

Anthony Ideas:
Psyche bar, pick up items et: teddy bears, flowers, books, boost psyche.


Move with WASD but also have a mouse that controls the direction you face, moving the screen like binding of isaac.
you could close eyes for a short period everytime screen moves to both give time for mouse adjustment and also have a grace period
for not agro-ing monsters.

ROLL DODGE ALWAYS TOWARDS MOUSE??? (Would be nutty)

*Random main character Blinking*

make TRAPS, get trap parts to stop enemies, can step in your own traps
Really lean into the Trap making aspect of the game as it is the only type of combat available to the character.

TRAP TYPES:
Bear Trap-


STATUS TYPES:

static, dizzy, blind, poison, corrosion, hypnotized, Epilepsy, 
---
Hypnotize: inverts WASD controls and look opposite of mouse.


UPGRADEABLE ITEMS:

Traps, Flashlights/Glow Sticks, Night Vision



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MONSTER STATES/INFO:
    - idle, sleep, roam, agrod, death
    - implement LOS (Line of Sight) that can be used for chasing/ranged attacking of enemies.

MONSTER IDEAS:

    Blob - can eat you and slow you down then spit you out.
    *blob with arm that pulls towards you while chasing,
    *camoflauge monster - clings to walls, can reach and grab you if you get too close to it. It emmits a dim light when it opens its
                eye which both extends its alert radius and can 
    Mimic - copies a flashlight
    Screamer - alerts things around it, itself isnt very dangerous, but the screamer while chasing has an alert radius like the
                player does, the screamers are blind, but are alerted themselves by a loud sound.
    *fast monster - deaf but 
    Ghost - mostly invisible, can go through walls, really slow and low alert radius
    Slopper - Vomits on you,
    *kamikaze type monster - homes in on you, really quiet, it tries to blow itself up on you
    *Tv Monster - Has a TV static screen with a bright light on its front facing side, its light can hypnotize you
    *monster that only moves when ur not looking at it* *wheeping angel* - 
    *angler fish monster - 
    *wolf in sheeps clothing -

MADE MONSTERS:

    Umo - 
    Zenba - Blind, big, moves slow, but once its agrod, it doesnt de agro until you teleport, so dont get this guy angry
        has a small agro radius BUT is only agrod by sound, so it should be easier to avoid, however, in times it might not
        be to avoidable in order to clear a level or get to where you want to go, usually the dont move too much and just rest.
        - low chance to agro other enemies, in which case, it speeds up 10x more than normal and kamikazees them
        - sits idle and usually needs to be lured away slowly
        - stops to use antenna to continually track you
        - if it gets into melee range it will kamikaze into you which is an insta kill if you are hit
        - they themselves dont make a lot of noise, similar threat style to a creeper in minecraft in that sense
        - their explosion leaves a toxic trail that will decay after 5 seconds, if walked on will poison you.
        - drops explosives and sludge in high amounts
